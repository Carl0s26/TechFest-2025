  "You: cool",
  "JASC: Thanks! If there's anything specific you'd like to discuss or need help with, feel free to let me know. I'm here to help!",
  "You: write something in bold",
  "JASC: To write something in bold, you can use a pair of asterisks or underscores around the text if you're using Markdown. For example, `**text**` or `__text__` will make the word appear in bold when the Markdown is rendered. If you're using a word processor like Microsoft Word, you can select the text and press \"Ctrl + B\" on your keyboard to make it bold. Try it out with the text you want to bold!",
  "You: what did i ask?",
  "JASC: I don't have the ability to recall previous interactions, so I can't remember what you asked earlier. However, you can repeat your question or provide more details, and I'll do my best to help you with it!",
  "You: write me some text in bold, write \"I am cool\" in bold",
  "JASC: To write the text \"I am cool\" in bold, you can use Markdown syntax by enclosing the text with double asterisks. For example: **I am cool**. If you're using a different platform, the method might vary, so checking the specific syntax for that platform could be helpful."
